# Keylogger
This project is an advanced keylogger developed in Python. It intelligently captures keyboard inputs, including correct handling for **Shift key states** and **numpad keys**, and sends the logs in real-time to a private Telegram chat. The data is sent immediately after specific actions like pressing `Space`, `Enter`, or `Backspace`.
